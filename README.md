# YoutubeDL_UI

This is just a really basic ui that allows the downloading of videos from youtube in mp4 or mp3 formats. 
It works for individual videos and playlists as well, just make sure to set the proper options in the dropdown menu. 
There is also an option to download thumbnails as well, which similar to mp4 and mp3 also works with playlists and individual videos. 
Popup messages also occur if there are any major issues, but most of them are for dumb mistakes so just use common sense when trying the application. 

To compile this, just make a venv and compile main.py. Make sure that moviepy and Pillow are installed, some IDEs just don't like to recognize them for whatever reason.
I plan to compile this into an .exe soon but am having issues with pyinstaller, will change the readme when this is done.
